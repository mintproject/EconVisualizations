# EconVisualizations

The zip file contains two folders:
- Using a lookup table as an input: contains 33,000 of the possible 11^15 combinations. When combination hasn't been run previously, doesn't return anything
- Live computation: runs the economic model when moving the sliders. Requires the following: GAMS application. Also need to change the subprocess function to where the GAMS app is located.

Movies show both styles of visualization.
